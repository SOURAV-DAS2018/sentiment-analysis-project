## 💡 Understanding the Code

You MUST understand this code to answer questions during presentation/evaluation. Here's what you need to know:

### Data Preprocessing
- **What:** Cleans and prepares text for neural network
- **How:** Removes noise, converts to numbers, pads sequences
- **Why:** Neural networks need numeric input of consistent length

### LSTM Architecture
- **What:** Recurrent neural network for sequence processing
- **How:** Maintains memory of previous words while reading review
- **Why:** Reviews are sequences - order of words matters

### Training Process
- **What:** Teaching the model to classify sentiments
- **How:** Shows examples, adjusts weights to minimize errors
- **Why:** Model learns patterns that indicate positive/negative sentiment

### Web Interface
- **What:** User-friendly way to interact with model
- **How:** Flask serves predictions via HTTP requests
- **Why:** Makes the system accessible to non-technical users
